# Customer-Segmentation

Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers into groups based on common characteristics so companies can market to each group effectively and appropriately. 

In business-to-business marketing, a company might segment customers according to a wide range of factors, including:
1. Industry
2. Number of employees
3. Products previously purchased from the company
4. Location

In business-to-consumer marketing, companies often segment customers according to demographics that include:
1. Age
2. Gender
3. Marital status
4. Location (urban, suburban, rural)
5. Life stage (single, married, divorced, empty-nester, retired, etc.)

Segmentation allows marketers to better tailor their marketing efforts to various audience subsets. Those efforts can relate to both communications and product development.

# Project Description

### Approach
The project uses the machine learning concept of clustering to segment these customers. 
### Algorithm
The algorithm used is the unsupervised learning algorithm K-Means Clustering.  
### Libraries
1. Numpy and Pandas to load and transform data.
2. Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize data.
3. Scikit-Learn for finding optimal 'k' using Elbow Method and Silhouette Method and for applying the K-Means algorithm.
